## Kmeans

Write a K-Means program

Requirements:

### 1. Implemented in Java language

### 2. K-Means clustering program with data points (x,y) using Euclidean distance to calculate proximity.

Inputs:

(1) Name of the test file;

Output:

cluster 1: x1,y1;x2,y2....

cluster 2: ....
...

cluster k: ....

Example file format:

First row: k value

Starting from the second line, each line is a data point (x,y)

"--END--" is the end symbol

The name of the data file is: test.txt

The contents of the file are as follows:
2

1,2

3,4

10,9

22,3

--END--

### 3. Submission checklist
(1) Java program source code;

(2) Program design description document describing the following 3 points.

a. The main design methodology of the program;

b. The number of iterations and its SSE change process, using graphical presentation;

c. Visualization of clustering results.
